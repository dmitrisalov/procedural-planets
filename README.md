# procedural-planets
A Godot application for procedurally generating 2D pixel-art planets.

## Description
The main portion of this project is the shader for generating 2D pixel-art style planets. The rest of the application is basically just a wrapper to allow users to easily generate and view planets.

The shader code is written in Godot's shading language, but it is similar enough to other popular shading languages (GLSL ES 3.0) that it can easily be repurposed for other applications.

## Usage
- Import, open, and run the project through Godot
- Hit the spacebar to generate new planets
